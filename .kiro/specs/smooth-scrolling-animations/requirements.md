# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the user experience by implementing smooth scrolling effects using Lenis and adding clean, performant animations to the process section. The goal is to create a fluid, professional browsing experience with scroll-triggered animations that engage users without compromising performance.

## Glossary

- **Lenis**: A lightweight, robust, and performant smooth scrolling library
- **Scroll_System**: The enhanced scrolling mechanism that provides smooth, momentum-based scrolling
- **Animation_Engine**: The system responsible for triggering and managing scroll-based animations
- **Process_Component**: The existing React component that displays the company's work process steps
- **Intersection_Observer**: Browser API used to detect when elements enter/exit the viewport
- **GSAP**: GreenSock Animation Platform for high-performance animations
- **Framer_Motion**: React animation library for declarative animations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want smooth scrolling throughout the site, so that navigation feels fluid and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls on any page, THE Scroll_System SHALL provide momentum-based smooth scrolling with natural easing
2. THE Scroll_System SHALL maintain 60fps performance during scroll operations
3. THE Scroll_System SHALL work consistently across desktop and mobile devices
4. THE Scroll_System SHALL preserve native scroll behavior for accessibility features
5. WHEN a user uses keyboard navigation, THE Scroll_System SHALL maintain smooth transitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the process section to animate smoothly as I scroll, so that the content feels engaging and interactive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a process step enters the viewport, THE Animation_Engine SHALL trigger a fade-in animation with upward motion
2. THE Animation_Engine SHALL stagger animations between process steps by 200ms intervals
3. WHILE a process step is visible, THE Animation_Engine SHALL maintain hover effects and micro-interactions
4. THE Animation_Engine SHALL animate the progress line to follow scroll position
5. WHEN animations are triggered, THE Animation_Engine SHALL complete within 800ms for optimal user experience

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want animations to be performant and not cause lag, so that the browsing experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Animation_Engine SHALL use hardware acceleration for all transform and opacity animations
2. THE Animation_Engine SHALL avoid animating layout-triggering CSS properties
3. WHEN multiple animations run simultaneously, THE Animation_Engine SHALL maintain 60fps performance
4. THE Animation_Engine SHALL respect user's reduced motion preferences
5. THE Animation_Engine SHALL cleanup event listeners and animation instances on component unmount

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want scroll-triggered animations to feel natural and not overwhelming, so that I can focus on the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN elements enter the viewport, THE Animation_Engine SHALL trigger animations only once per element
2. THE Animation_Engine SHALL use easing functions that feel natural and not mechanical
3. THE Animation_Engine SHALL provide subtle entrance animations that enhance rather than distract from content
4. WHILE scrolling quickly, THE Animation_Engine SHALL handle rapid viewport changes gracefully
5. THE Animation_Engine SHALL maintain animation consistency across different scroll speeds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the animation system to be maintainable and extensible, so that future enhancements can be easily implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Animation_Engine SHALL provide reusable animation hooks and components
2. THE Animation_Engine SHALL separate animation logic from component rendering logic
3. THE Animation_Engine SHALL provide configurable animation parameters through props or configuration
4. THE Animation_Engine SHALL include TypeScript types for all animation-related interfaces
5. THE Animation_Engine SHALL follow React best practices for performance and state management
